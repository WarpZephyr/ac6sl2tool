# ac6sl2tool
Decrypts and encrypts the files inside of Armored Core 6 SL2 saves.  
Also recalculates the checksum at the end of files before encrypting them again.  
The SL2 itself is a Binder4 archive. Use [WitchyBND][0] or [Yabber][1] to unpack it first.

# Credits
Thanks to Nordgaren for creating [ArmoredCore6SaveTransferTool][2] which the SL2 code was modified from.
